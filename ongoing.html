                <u> 1/28/23</u>: So, I've never done anything like this before. In fact, I am only here because on night I was up with my friend <b> <a href="https://shmage.xyz/"> Shmage</a> </b> and tried to setup a <b> <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/"> Hugo</a> </b> website. Yeah that flopped after we tried for like 6 hours. So here we are now doing it in HTML because I actually know how to do that from taking IS 4020 in fall of 2022!
                I am very much a beginner to these things and I'm learning more and more as I continue to develope this website (one thing that is annoying is that stupid blue line inbetween the new row of text...GO AWAY). Over time my CSS skills will get better...I hope.
                For right now I just want to have this here because I do enjoy coding and designing something that I can own and do whatever I want with. I get turned away from coding so easily when there are set restrictions on what I can do and add...hence why I am an IS major
                instead of a CS major. So yeah here we are slowly but surely making this website whatever I want it to be at the expense of only $12/year to own the domain! <br> <br>

                <u> 1/30/23</u>: It's been a few days of having this website and really all I have to say is that I am extremely happy with how much I have learned and how this website is turning out. It feels good to just start out with a little file named 'index.html' and see
                how far you can really branch out from there. I have so many ideas planned and additions for the future of this site. Slowly but surely I will be improving and building upon this to have a sort of generalized content area with everything I want. But for now, we continue to chip
                away at the small things and continue to learn and apply the knowledge I am getting every single day. Oh also for a lot of these sorts of 'update' posts, I just write whatever the heck comes to my mind and press some buttons then watch the funny little letters appear on my screen. I don't really
                care if some of these look weird or strange or sound wrong because in the end that's what im thinking about. Yeah idk...woohoo website updates! Also I can't wait for a year to go by and I get to look back and read all of these, I truly enjoy doing that so much. I really am a person that loves looking back
                on things I've done with my life or people I've met! <br /> <br />

                <u>2/21/2023 </u>: The Meister returns! I've had a lot going on in my personal life (school, family matters, extra curriculars, etc) but I finally found a little bit of time to write an update post. Recently I just haven't been feeling 100%
                with doing things in general. I'm losing a lot of my motivation I feel like and am bored 24/7. A lot of things just aren't that fun anymore. So am I just going to sit here and complain? Well no not really. I joined a club here at BGSU called
                International Football Club. We meet every Tuesday/Thursday here at BG for some pickup soccer for 2 hours. It honestly feels good to be getting out more and meeting new people and doing something physical rather than just buying a new game and sitting
                in my chair all evening. So again, I am glad to finally start to find some time to come back to this and share my thoughts. Just somewhere to express everything ya know. With a lot of the first-round midterms wrapping up I have a lot more time to myself
                and can do the things I want to again. So we will see what happens from here on out.
