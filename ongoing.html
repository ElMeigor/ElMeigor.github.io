       <u> 1/28/23</u> : So, I've never done anything like this before. In fact, I am only here because on night I was up with my friend <a href="https://shmage.xyz/"> Shmage </a> and tried to setup a <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/"> Hugo </a> website. Yeah that flopped after we tried for like 6 hours. So here we are now doing it in HTML because I actually know how to do that from taking IS 4020 in fall of 2022!
        I am very much a beginner to these things and I'm learning more and more as I continue to develope this website (one thing that is annoying is that stupid blue line inbetween the new row of text...GO AWAY). Over time my CSS skills will get better...I hope. 
        For right now I just want to have this here because I do enjoy coding and designing something that I can own and do whatever I want with. I get turned away from coding so easily when there are set restrictions on what I can do and add...hence why I am an IS major
        instead of a CS major. So yeah here we are slowly but surely making this website whatever I want to be at the expense of only $12/year to own the domain! <br> <br>

        <u> More Coming Soon!</u> : There's nothing here
