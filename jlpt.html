            So what did I mean when I said, "Omg I need to do something else with my time but what?" Yep, this is what I decided on. My main motive is mainly to travel to Japan sometime. I want to be able to speak some of the language
            so I don't die while I am out there. I also think it is common courtesy to know the language of the country you're visiting. You are exploring their life and culture so try and make it easy on them. So yeah this is everything
            that I have done throughout the journey!
