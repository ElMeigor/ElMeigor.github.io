                First off yeah sorry for not being here for so long. Like I said on the main page it really has just been not wanting to put any work towards this website, however, as you can see from the title of this post I am
                starting to change some things up. What it really has been is I am just getting tired of competetive-style games. The strain it puts on you to be performing at your absolute best, practice, and sweat everyday just made the games unenjoybale
                for me. I am mainly talking about Rocket League. I have always loved esports and competing and I was beyond excited when I got the chance to play live for a collegiate team. I mean...how cool is that!? Things have taken a huge turn however, especially
                over the Summer of 2023, when the entire team started to turn away from the game. It wasn't fun anymore, we started to play less, more and more mistakes were happening, and it just <i> wasn't what it used to be.</i> I tried to quit severall times but
                always ended up just going back to the game and playing again, going up and down some mmr here and there, enjoying the game for a week then saying I hate it again...something's got to change. My biggest problem has been saying I am going to quit
                and then failing to find something to fill in the time with. I would just sit there bored while having my steam library open right in front of me. There it is, yelling my name to come back and play and I just didn't know what to do. I'm starting to
                find new hobbies and revisit some old things I used to enjoy to try and fill in the time and so far it is working out quite nicely! Hopefully things continue this way and continues to have a positive effect.
